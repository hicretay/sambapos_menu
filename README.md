# SAMBAPOS MENU

This project is my first job study case. In less than 48 hours, I designed a menu using the menu.yaml file in the /assets folder. Therefore, it is a simple and quickly written project. Only "yaml: ^3.1.0" used in dependencies. It is a is a sample project for parsing example.yaml files.
